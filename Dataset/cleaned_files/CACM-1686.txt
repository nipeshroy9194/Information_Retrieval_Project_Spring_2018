computer synthesis of holograms for 3d display optical and digital holography are reviewed the mathematical model and computational techniques of the authors digital holographic process are discussed and applications of computer holography are suggested computer holograms have been made of threedimensional objects which give faithful reconstructions even in white light a new approach based on point apertures for the image is discussed photographs of the images reconstructed from digital holograms are presented cacm october 1968 lesem l b hirsch p m holography optics fourier transforms computer applications display device photography physics mathematics image processing 317 319 519 ca681001 jb february 21 1978 427 pm 1686 5 1686 1686 5 1686 1686 5 1686 2004 5 1686 1686 6 1686 1915 6 1686
