storageefficient representation of decimal data usually n decimal digits are represented by 4n bits in computers actually two bcd digits can be compressed optimally and reversibly into 7 bits and three digits into 10 bits by a very simple algorithm based on the fixedlength combination of two variable fieldlength encodings in over half of the cases the compressed code results from the conventional bcd code by simple removal of redundant 0 bits a long decimal message can be subdivided into threedigit blocks and separately compressed the result differs from the asymptotic minimum length by only 034 percent the hardware requirement is small and the mappings can be done manually cacm january 1975 chi chen t ho i t binarycoded decimal digits decimal data storage 632 634 ca750110 jb january 12 1978 942 am 2729 5 2801 2801 5 2801 2801 5 2801 2801 5 2801 2288 6 2801 2801 6 2801
