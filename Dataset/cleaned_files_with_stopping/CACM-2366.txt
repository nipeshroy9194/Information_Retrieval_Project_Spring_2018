 complex gamma function with error control an algorithm to compute the gamma function and log gamma function of a complex variable is presented the standard algorithm is modified in several respects to insure the continuity of the function value and to reduce accumulation of roundoff errors in addition to computation of function values this algorithm includes an objecttime estimation of roundoff errors experimental data with regard to the effectiveness of this error control are presented a fortran program for the algorithm appears in the algorithms section of this issue cacm april 1972 kuki h complex gamma function gamma function complex log gamma function loggamma function roundoff error control inherent error control runtime error estimates error estimates 511 512 ca720407 jb january 31 1978 1259 pm 2366	4	2366 2364	5	2366 2366	5	2366 2366	5	2366 2366	5	2366 2366	6	2366
