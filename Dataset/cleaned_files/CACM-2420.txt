experiments with an automatic theoremprover havingpartial ordering inference rules automatic theoremprovers need to be made much more efficient with this in mind slagle has shown how the axioms for partial ordering can be replaced by builtin inference rules when using a particular theoremproving algorithm based upon hyperresolution and paramodulation the new rules embody the transitivity of partial orderings and the close relationship between predicates a program has been developed using a modified version of these rules this new theoremprover has been found to be very powerful for solving problems involving partial orderings this paper presents a detailed description of the program and a comprehensive account of the experiments that have been performed with it cacm november 1973 slagle j r norton l m theoremproving partial ordering resolution hyperresolution p1resolution paramodulation inference rules heuristics 364 366 ca731106 jb january 20 1978 1010 am 2356 4 2420 2420 4 2420 2874 4 2420 3143 4 2420 2227 5 2420 2420 5 2420 2420 5 2420 2420 5 2420
