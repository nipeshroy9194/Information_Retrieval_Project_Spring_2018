contextsensitive parsing this paper presents a canonical form for contextsensitive derivations and a parsing algorithm which finds each contextsensitive analysis once and only once the amount of memory required by the algorithm is essentially no more than the required to store a single complete derivation in addition a modified version of the basic algorithm is presented which blocks infinite analyses for grammars which contain loops the algorithm is also compared with several previous parsers for contextsensitive grammars and general rewriting systems and the difference between the two types of analyses is discussed the algorithm appears to be complementary to an algorithm by s kuno in several respects including the spacetime tradeoff and the degree of context dependence involved cacm july 1970 woods w a contextsensitive grammars contextsensitive parsing formal grammars formal language theory parsing parsing algorithms recognition algorithms 342 522 523 ca700707 jb february 10 1978 443 pm 2030 5 2030 2030 5 2030 2030 5 2030
