 on the expected lengths of sequences generated in sorting by replacement selecting in the replacementselecting technique of sorting one is interested in the ratio lj of the expected length of the jth sequence generated by the technique to the number of memory cells used using complexvariable theory it is shown that lj 2 and that asymptotically the average interval between sign changes of lj2 is 26662 cacm july 1969 hooker w w replacement selecting sorting sequence lengths asymptotic expected length recursion relation generating function meromorphic function 374 531 ca690713 jb february 15 1978 637 pm 1867	4	1867 2272	4	1867 1638	5	1867 1867	5	1867 1867	5	1867 1867	5	1867
