 focus microcomputer number system focus is a number system and supporting computational algorithms especially useful for microcomputer control and other signal processing applications focus has the wideranging character of floatingpoint numbers with a uniformity of state distributions that give focus better than a twofold accuracy advantage over an equal word length floatingpoint system focus computations are typically five times faster than single precision fixedpoint or integer arithmetic for a mixture of operations comparable in speed with hardware arithmetic for many applications algorithms for 8bit and 16bit implementations of focus are included cacm march 1979 edgar a lee s number representation logarithmic arithmetic computational speed computational accuracy microcomputer applications 324 380 40 422 511 ca790302 dh april 12 1979 1112 am 3131	4	3131 3131	4	3131 1148	5	3131 3131	5	3131 3131	5	3131 3131	5	3131 893	5	3131
