 coldstart vs warmstart miss ratios in a twolevel computer storage hierarchy miss ratio measurements are often made from a cold start that is made with the firstlevel store initially empty for large capacities the effect on the measured miss ratio of the misses incurred while filling the firstlevel store can be significant even for long reference strings use of warmstart rather than coldstart miss ratios cast doubt on the widespread belief that the observed sshape of lifetime reciprocal of miss ratio versus capacity curve indicates a property of behavior of programs that maintain a constant number of pages in main storage on the other hand if coldstart miss ratios are measured as a function of capacity and measurement length then they are useful in studying systems in which operation of a program is periodically interrupted by task switches it is shown how to obtain under simple assumptions the cache miss ratio for multiprogramming from coldstart miss ratio values and how to obtain approximate coldstart miss ratios from warmstart miss ratios cacm october 1978 easton m fagin r miss ratio cold start warm start storage hierarchy lifetime function multiprogramming sshape 370 432 935 ca781009 dh january 29 1979 516 pm 2374	4	3052 2481	4	3052 2669	4	3052 2863	4	3052 3016	4	3052 3052	4	3052 1901	5	3052 3052	5	3052 3052	5	3052 3052	5	3052
