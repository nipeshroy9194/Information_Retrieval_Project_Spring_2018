 a comparison of treebalancing algorithms several algorithmsheightbalance ie avl and extensions weightbalance ie bb and wb and total restructuringfor building balanced binary search trees are compared the criteria for comparison encompass theoretical aspects eg path lengths and implementation independent and machinealgorithmdependent measures eg run time a detailed analysis of code is also presented at a level believed to be languageand compilerindependent the quality of the resulting trees and the overhead spent on building them are analyzed and some guidelines are given for an efficient use of the methods if insertion and subsequent queries are the only operations of in terest then pure avl trees present the overall best qualities cacm may 1977 baer j l schwab b binary search trees avl trees weightbalanced trees path length analysis of algorithms information storage and retrieval 37 372 374 531 ca770504 jb december 29 1977 216 am 2455	4	2968 2493	4	2968 2889	4	2968 2889	4	2968 2968	4	2968 2968	4	2968 3042	4	2968 2388	5	2968 2455	5	2968 2968	5	2968 2968	5	2968 2968	5	2968 3042	5	2968 2455	6	2968 2839	6	2968 2889	6	2968 2968	6	2968
