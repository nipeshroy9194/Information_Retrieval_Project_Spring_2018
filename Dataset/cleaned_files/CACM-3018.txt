covering edges by cliques with regard to keyword conflicts and intersection graphs kellerman has presented a method for determining keyword conflicts and described a heuristic algorithm which solves a certain combinatorial optimization problem in connection with this method this optimization problem is here shown to be equivalent to the problem of covering the edges of a graph by complete subgraphs with the objective of minimizing the number of complete subgraphs a relationship between this edgecliquecover problem and the graph coloring problem is established which allows algorithms for either one of these problems to be constructed from algorithm for the other as consequences of this relationship the keyword conflict problem and the edgecliquecover problem are shown to be npcomplete and if pnp then they do not admit polynomialtime approximation algorithms which always produce solutions within a factor less than 2 from the optimum cacm february 1978 kou l stockmeyer l wong c watson t keyword conflicts intersection graphs node clique cover edge clique cover computational complexity npcomplete problems polynomialtime heuristics 412 525 532 ca780205 jb march 28 1978 418 pm 3018 5 3018 3018 5 3018 3018 5 3018
