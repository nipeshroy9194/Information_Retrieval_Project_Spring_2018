 the conversion of limitedentry decision tables to optimal and nearoptimal flowcharts two new algorithms two new algorithms for deriving optimal and nearoptimal flowcharts from limited entry decision tables are presented both take into account rule frequencies and the time needed to test conditions one of the algorithms called the optimumfinding algorithm leads to a flowchart which truly minimizes execution time for a decision table in which simple rules are already contracted to complex rules the other one called the optimumapproaching algorithm requires many fewer calculations but does not necessarily produce the optimum flowchart the algorithms are first derived for treating decision tables not containing an elserule but the optimumapproaching algorithm is shown to be equally valid for tables including such a rule both algorithms are compared with existing ones and are applied to a somewhat large decision table derived from a real case from this comparison two conclusions are drawn 1 the optimumapproaching algorithm will usually lead to better results than comparable existing ones and will not require more but usually less computation time2 in general the greater computation effort needed for applying the optimumfinding algorithm will not be justified by the small reduction in execution time obtained cacm november 1972 verhelst m decision table flowcharting preprocessor optimal programs search 350 359 419 429 449 531 ca721106 jb january 27 1978 210 pm 2263	5	2263 2263	5	2263 2263	5	2263 2598	5	2263 2691	5	2263 2726	5	2263 3113	5	2263 1172	6	2263 1172	6	2263 1327	6	2263 1354	6	2263 1354	6	2263 1488	6	2263 1489	6	2263 1548	6	2263 1548	6	2263 2220	6	2263 2220	6	2263 2221	6	2263 2263	6	2263 2263	6	2263 2263	6	2263 2263	6	2263 2453	6	2263 2598	6	2263 2691	6	2263 2691	6	2263 2856	6	2263
