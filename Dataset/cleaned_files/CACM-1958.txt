improving roundoff in rungekutta computations with gills method a rungekuttagill scheme in common use is based on an incomplete adaptation for floating point operations of gills method an improved version reduces roundoff error significantly in this note the heart of the scheme is presented in fortran language it is then shown how an improved version of the method can be obtained with the addition of two fortran statements the two version is a significant improvement a numerical example comparing the two is included cacm december 1970 thompson r j rungekutta methods ordinary differential equations roundoff error error analysis 511 517 ca701205 jb february 9 1978 340 pm 1958 5 1958 1958 5 1958 1958 5 1958
