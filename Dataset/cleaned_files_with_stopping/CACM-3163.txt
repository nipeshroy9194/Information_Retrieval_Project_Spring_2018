 an optimal insertion algorithm for onesided heightbalanced binary search trees an algorithm for inserting an element into a onesided heightbalanced oshb binary search tree is presented the algorithm operates in time olog n where n is the number of nodes in the tree this represents an improvement over the best previous ly known insertion algorithms of hirschberg and kosaraju which require time olog 2n moreover the olog n complexity is optimal earlier results have shown that deletion in such a structure can also be performed in olog n time thus the result of this paper gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should be the first examples of their kind where deletion has a smaller time complexity than insertion furthermore it can now be concluded that insertion deletion and retrieval in oshb trees can be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for the more general avl trees to within a constant factor however the insertion and deletion algorithms for oshb trees appear much more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for avl trees cacm september 1979 raihak zweben s insertion onesided heightbalanced trees heightbalanced trees binary trees search trees 373 374 434 525 531 ca790904 db january 14 1980 1147 am 2839	4	3163 3009	4	3163 3042	4	3163 3042	4	3163 3065	4	3163 3065	4	3163 3096	4	3163 3096	4	3163 3096	4	3163 3163	4	3163 3163	4	3163 3163	4	3163 3163	4	3163 3163	4	3163 2839	5	3163 2889	5	3163 3009	5	3163 3065	5	3163 3096	5	3163 3163	5	3163 3163	5	3163 3163	5	3163
