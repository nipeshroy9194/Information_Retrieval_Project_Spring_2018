assembling code for machines with spandependent instructions many modern computers contain instructions whose lengths depend on the distance from a given instance of such an instruction to the operand of that instruction this paper considers the problem of minimizing the lengths of programs for such machines an efficient solution is presented for the case in which the operand of every such spandependent instruction is either a label or an assemblytime expression of a certain restricted formf this restriction is relaxed by allowing these operands to be more general assemblytime expressions then the problem is shown to be npcomplete cacm april 1978 szymanski t spandependent instructions variablelength addressing code generation assemblers compilers npcomplete computational complexity 411 412 525 ca780406 dh february 26 1979 349 pm 2626 4 3110 2786 4 3110 2840 4 3110 2858 4 3110 2919 4 3110 3017 4 3110 3110 4 3110 3110 4 3110 3110 4 3110 3174 4 3110 2194 5 3110 2629 5 3110 2858 5 3110 3110 5 3110 3110 5 3110 3110 5 3110
