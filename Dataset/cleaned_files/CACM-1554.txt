a computer technique for displaying ndimensional hyperobjects a digital computer and automatic plotter have been used to generate threedimensional stereoscopic movies of the threedimensional parallel and perspective projections of fourdimensional hyperobjects rotating in fourdimensional space the observed projections and their motions were a direct extension of threedimensional experience but no profound feeling or insight into the fourth spatial dimension was obtained the technique can be generalized to ndimensions and applied to any ndimensional hyperobject or hypersurface cacm august 1967 noll a m ca670801 jb february 27 1978 448 pm 1554 5 1554 1554 5 1554 1554 5 1554 2211 5 1554 1554 6 1554 1741 6 1554
