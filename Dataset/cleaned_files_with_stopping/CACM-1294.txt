 note on tripleprecision floatingpoint arithmetic with 132bit numbers in a recent paper gregory and raney described a technique for doubleprecision floatingpoint arithmetic a similar technique can be developed for tripleprecision floatingpoint arithmetic and it is the purpose of this note to describe this technique only the multiplication and the division algorithms are described since the additionsubtraction algorithm can be obtained by a trivial modification of the algorithm in gregorys and raneys paper cacm march 1965 ikebe y ca650313 jb march 7 1978 554 pm 1294	4	1294 1152	5	1294 1294	5	1294 1294	5	1294 1294	5	1294
