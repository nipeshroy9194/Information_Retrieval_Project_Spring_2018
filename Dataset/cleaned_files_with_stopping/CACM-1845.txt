 loader standardization for overlay programs the overlay capability is described for four of the third generation computer systems cdc6000 ge635 ibm360 and univac1108 a critique of the first three systems is based on actual experience with a large overlaid trajectory simulation program a short history and description of this program is presented a standardization of minimum capabilities for loaders is recommended so that programs which must operate under more than one computer system may be easily converted and maintained a proposal that overlay software incorporates a memory occupation specification concept instead of the conditional tree structure is delineated this concept provides more efficient and costeffective utilization of the memory as well as increased flexibility in program structure cacm october 1969 lanzano b c loader overlay partition region segmentation linkage linkage editor standardization memory utilization memory occupation tree structure cdc6000 ge635 ibm360 univac1108 410 412 419 440 ca691001 jb february 15 1978 409 pm 1845	4	1845 1900	4	1845 2083	4	1845 2154	4	1845 2270	4	1845 2693	4	1845 988	5	1845 1845	5	1845 1845	5	1845 1845	5	1845 2343	5	1845 1173	6	1845 1774	6	1845 1845	6	1845
