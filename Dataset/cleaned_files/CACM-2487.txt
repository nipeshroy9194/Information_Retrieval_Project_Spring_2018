cubic spline solutions to fourthorder boundary value problems the cubic spline approximation to the fourthorder differential equation ypxyqxyrxytx is shown to reduce to the solution of a fiveterm recurrence relationship for some special cases the approximation is shown to be simply related to a finite difference representation with a local truncation error of order y720delta8 cacm june 1973 hoskins w d cubic spline differential equations boundary value problem 513 517 ca730613 jb january 23 1978 144 pm 2487 5 2487 2487 5 2487 2487 5 2487
