 synchronizing processors with memorycontentgenerated interrupts implementations of the lockunlock method of synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor system usually require uninterruptable memorypause type instructions an interlock scheme called readinterlock which does not require memorypause instructions has been developed for a dual dec pdp10 system with realtime requirements the readinterlock method does require a specialreadinterlock instruction in the repertoire of the processors and a special readinterlock cycle in the repertoire of the memory modules when a processor examines a lock a memory location with a readinterlock instruction it will be interrupted if the lock was already set examining a lock immediately sets it if it was not already set this event sequence is a readinterlock cycle writing into a lock clears it having the processor interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of branching is advantageous if the branch would have resulted in an effective interrupt cacm june 1973 hill j c interruptssupervisors monitors debugging parallel processing associative memories microprogramming 432 629 ca730603 jb january 23 1978 329 pm 1458	4	2497 1523	4	2497 1603	4	2497 1698	4	2497 1747	4	2497 1748	4	2497 1854	4	2497 1877	4	2497 1960	4	2497 2377	4	2497 2378	4	2497 2497	4	2497 2497	4	2497 2534	4	2497 2558	4	2497 2625	4	2497 2632	4	2497 2840	4	2497 2941	4	2497 3105	4	2497 3144	4	2497 1471	5	2497 2182	5	2497 2497	5	2497 2497	5	2497 2497	5	2497
