designing surfaces in 3d an experimental system for computeraided design of freeform surfaces in three dimensions is described the surfaces are represented in the system as parametric basis splines the principal features of the system are 1 the surfaces are rendered as isoparametric line drawings on a headmounted display and they are designed with the aid of a threedimensional wand which allows 3d movements of the points controlling the shapes of the surfaces 2 all of the interactions with the surfaces are in realtime and 3 the mathematical formulations used assume no knowledge of them by the user of the system also examined are some of the features that should be part of a practical 3d system for designing spaceforms cacm august 1976 clark j h realtime graphics computeraided design picture processing bsplines 3d displays 380 622 82 ca760803 jb january 4 1978 1025 am 2828 5 2841 2841 5 2841 2841 5 2841 2841 5 2841 1751 6 2841 2004 6 2841 2751 6 2841 2841 6 2841
