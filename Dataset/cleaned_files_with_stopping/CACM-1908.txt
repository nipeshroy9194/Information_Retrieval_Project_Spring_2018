 timesharing and batchprocessing an experimental comparison of their values in a problem solving situation an experimental comparison of problemsolving using timesharing and batchprocessing computer systems conducted at mit is described in this paper this study is the first known attempt to evaluate two such systems for what may well be the predominant user population within the next decadethe professionals who as nonprogrammers are using the computer as an aid in decisionmaking and problemsolving rather than as a programming end in itself statistically and logically significant results indicate equal cost for usage of the two computer systems however a much higher level of performance is attained by timesharing users there are indications that significantly lower costs would have resulted if the timesharing users had stopped work when they reached a performance level equal to that of the batch users the users speed of problemsolving and their attitudes made timesharing the more favorable system cacm may 1969 gold m m timesharing vs batchprocessing user performance manmachine communications cost effectiveness online vs offline performance decisionmaking performance userprogrammer behavior programming experimental empirical studies problemsolving research in manmachine communications manmachine symbiosis 211 240 336 351 380 ca690501 jb february 17 1978 410 pm 1792	4	1908 1908	4	1908 1908	4	1908 1550	5	1908 1605	5	1908 1908	5	1908 1908	5	1908 1908	5	1908 2705	5	1908 2984	5	1908 1908	6	1908 1908	6	1908 3185	6	1908
