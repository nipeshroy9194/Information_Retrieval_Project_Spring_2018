statespace problemreduction and theorem provingsome relationships this paper suggests a bidirectional relationship between statespace and problemreduction representations it presents a formalism based on multipleinput and multipleoutput operators which provides a basis for viewing the two types of representations in this manner a representation of the language recognition problem which is based on the cocke parsing algorithm is used as an illustration a method for representing problems in firstorder logic in such a way that the inference system employed by a resolutionbased theorem prover determines whether the set of clauses is interpreted in the statespacer mode or in the problemreduction mode is presented the analogous concepts in problemreduction and theorem proving and the terminology used to refer to them are noted the relationship between problemreduction input resolution and linear resolution is discussed cacm february 1975 vanderbrug g j minker j artificial intelligence statespace representation problemreduction representation theorem proving language recognition 364 ca750205 jb january 12 1978 827 am 2794 5 2794 2794 5 2794 2794 5 2794
