on the distributions of significant digits and roundoff errors generalized logarithmic law is derived for the distribution of the first t significant digits of a random digital integer this result is then used to determine the distribution of the roundoff errors in floatingpoint operations which is a mixture of uniform and reciprocal distributions cacm may 1974 tsao n significant digits floatingpoint operations roundoff errors uniform distribution reciprocal distribution variance mean valve 510 511 ca740504 jb january 17 1978 412 pm 2649 5 2649 2649 5 2649 2649 5 2649
